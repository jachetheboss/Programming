# explore the type of dynamic programming question where you 
# find the total distinct number of ways to split a string
# into non-overlapping substrings. Dynamic programming, also a greedy
# more mathematical algorithm involving having the choice to stop
# the current substring and start a new one, or let the current substring
# keep going? Some type of dynamic programming similar to number
# of ways to tile a floor using dominoes and trominoes

# if there are n contiguous elements, there are 2**(n - 1) distinct
# ways to partition them into substrings.
