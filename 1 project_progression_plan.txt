MIT OpenCourseWare projects
starting from programming I, II, DSA, OS, Comp Arch, ML, AI,
etc. DO A BUNCH OF PROJECTS!

Embark on tennis computer vision project, statistics, playstyle,
shot quality, winning % betting prediction, etc.,
2 eventual goals: build a functioning tennis robot, choose
a player to play against, pro, college, or random, choose
UTR to play against, allow the robot to learn how to play like
anybody once given 1 hour of sample footage.

Ability to play with any racquet, any balls, quick adjustment
algorithm. Adjust based on temperature, humidity, court speed,
altitude, wind, old balls, shit racquet, dead strings, shit grip,
size 3 grip, size 5 grip, etc. SO MANY VARIABLES!

***Bonus*** Give audio grunt effects to robot, instead of wheels
or treads, give it human bipedal running ability.
***Bonus*** Give robot the ability to coach, analyze your play
in real-time (feedback e.g. "you're hitting too shallow, play
deeper" "good ball" "excellent ball" "put more spin" "too early" 
"too late" "hitting down the middle too much" "don't drop the
racquet so much" "don't slap" **add in jokes** "you're shit" 
"nice shot babe")
***Bonus*** all-in-one robot, include built-in speaker for playing
music, instead of lugging a separate JBL to each practice.
***Bonus*** allow drill feed ability, Spanish death drill, bowtie
drill, crosscourts, DTL, overhead feeds, baseline-to-volley drill,
***Bonus*** interactive touchscreen display, handheld remote,
wifi-connected keyboard, figure out the I/O of the robot!
***Bonus*** make robot foldable to carry like a suitcase, like
Iron Man 2
***Bonus*** make robot walkable on its own, don't have to carry
or push it
