Hello Kim and Jeremy,

I thoroughly enjoyed the interview earlier today. Both of you made clear what sorts of experiences and mindsets you are looking for in a candidate. I already had an amazing impression of this particular position a couple of weeks ago during the 15-minute call - today's discussion affirmed it. From our dialogue today, you mentioned that this is the first-ever recruiting cycle for the position. Hearing that has made me even more excited about this role since I am eager to not only learn, but also to deliver novel outcomes for John Deere and society. Being able to enter new waters with the team would be an invaluable opportunity to have.

To reiterate some selling points I made during the interview, I am a top fit for the role for multiple reasons. Firstly, I am confident that my Python and data analysis experience gained from my research would carry over seamlessly to the internship. Secondly, my great attention to detail would also translate to success on the job. Finally, I am fully invested in this opportunity - I come from a long line of farmers, so I am truly passionate about John Deere's central purpose and mission.

Feel free to contact me at any time if you need further information about me. Many thanks to you for taking the time to conduct the interview today!

Sincerely,
James Shen
