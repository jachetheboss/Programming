class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:

        + or - sign stack to flip all signs in the parenthesis
        when parenthesis opens, push 0 onto stack (in new scope, sum is zero), this even takes care of expressions such as ((())), 
just a bunch of zeroes 0, 0, 0 in the scope
        value stack keeping track of cummulative total in each scope
