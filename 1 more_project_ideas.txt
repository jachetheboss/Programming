make a computer vision live tennis tracking video project, analyze
strategy to assist in tennis betting, can backtest this, see if
it is profitable. What styles match up better, put into account the
betting odds, use historical h2h matchup data, point-level tactics,
distance ran so far, fitness level, etc., build up a massive statistical
model, make sports exciting! Probably works best for top players where
there is plenty of footage. More difficult to do this for challenger
level matches? But all challenger matches are livestreamed as well!

Machine learning models of winning percentage for each player in real
time already exist, can we make a more accurate one? Side by side
comparison, if it is even more accurate than the betting site version,
than we can win money! Compare which betting site has the more accurate
betting model, can exploit that one, until account is banned?
